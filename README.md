Code2STL
======

Lets be honest, programming has always been quite boring, staring at plain old 2D pages of code ..., now with `code2stl`, a **Revolution** is coming, **3D** code like you’ve never seen it before !

3D code is **scientifically proven** to **change** your perspective on code, fixing ugly portions of code such as callback hells, code duplication and many other horrors that have riddled the 2d world of the past.

Fear no more, code is now beautiful thanks to our patent pending, world class 3d rendering engine !

3D code is the salvation programmers have been waiting for, wait no more and join the future by using **code2stl**, and awesome **brogramming** !!!

This is a highly profitable venture, many high profile companies are trying to own this market, it's not a coincidence if GitHub [launched their STL viewer](https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing).
